# Get Stuff Done - Alfred version

An Alfred workflow that allows you to block websites (such as social
networks, news websites, etc) by editing the /etc/hosts file. Loosely
based on [gsd.sh](https://github.com/jcromartie/gsd.sh).

# Instructions

in order to block the annoying web sites and start working. Use

    gsd play
    
for some fun waste of time!

# Adding/removing websites

Currently you go to Alfred settings -> Workflows -> Right click "Get Stuff
Done" -> Show in Finder -> edit the `gsd.sh` file
